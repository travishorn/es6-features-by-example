# ES6 Features by Example

ECMAScript 6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is the upcoming version of the ECMAScript standard. This standard is targeting ratification in June 2015. ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of these features in major JavaScript engines is [underway now](http://kangax.github.io/es5-compat-table/es6/).

See the [draft ES6 standard](https://people.mozilla.org/~jorendorff/es6-draft.html) for full specification of the ECMAScript 6 language.

The descriptions and code examples on this site are taken from an MIT-licensed [project by Luke Hoban](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) and have been modified to provide examples runnable in your browser. All examples are transpiled to ES5 first before being included on each page. If you'd like to see the ES5 version, check out the es5 directory.
